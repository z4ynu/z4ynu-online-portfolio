                    I chose Computer Science because of my long-time love for technology, supported and encouraged by my family. At first, I had to choose between pursuing music or IT, but in the end, my path led me to Computer Science. It became the perfect balance of passion and opportunity.

                    I'm currently a 4th-year Computer Science student working on my thesis. The start of college was challenging as I adjusted to new demands, but I've continued to push through and grow. Back in high school, I was a consistent achiever, and that drive still guides me today as I face every challenge with persistence.

                    Outside academics, I serve as a musician at Tagum Alliance Gospel Church and have joined multiple battle of the bands. I also enjoy competing in Valorant tournaments, hanging out with friends, and spending time with my girlfriend, Kissay. These experiences remind me that growth comes not only from studies but also from the passions and people who shape who I am.
